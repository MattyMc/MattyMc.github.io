If there existed a word cloud that floated over me, it would likely contain the terms math geek, computer nerd, educator, philosopher, essayist, web developer, hacker, boyfriend, brother, son, football fan, martial artist, adventurer and friend; among others. 

Professionally, I enjoy making things, learning things, thinking about how humans experience the world and connecting with people. As such, this website's content ranges from essays to technical tutorials.
