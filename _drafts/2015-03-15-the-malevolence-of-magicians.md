It was fourth week of my second year of my mathematics degree that I felt for the first time that there was a very real chance I wasn't going to make it.  

Until this point, school had been going quite well for me. I had breezed through my first year courses without any major hurdles, had made a few new friends, and had even found a mentor in my first year Calculus professor.  

During this time I had also witnessed an exodus of students from my program. We began our first year classes with enough students to fill a large lecture hall, and now we were a mere 20 or so funnelled away into some small computer lab in the corner of the school. Such a large amount of attrition had also fostered a strange social dynamic within the group. You either "got it" or you didn't, and by extension you were either a person who "got it" or a person who didn't. There was no middle ground. And if you didn't get it, you might as well stop wasting everyone's time. I was terrified at the idea that I might be becoming one of those people who just didn't get it. 

"Please everyone take your seats," asked our professor, "Today we will be continuing our discussion of topics in probability theory." **Great, I thought. Here comes my bi-weekly reminder of how I'm not cut-out to study mathematics**.
  
In the class, Ryan was someone who clearly got it. He would sit in the front row of the computer lab, usually in the center. When the professor would pause and ask a question of the group, Ryan's hand would be the first, fastest, and only hand to fly into the air. His answer would be perfect, he would slightly revel in the praise he would receive from the professor, and this process would repeat every few minutes, each class. 

It was a week later that I arrived to class a little early. Ryan was seated in his usual spot, and I shuffled along the first row to sit next to a friend of mine, just to the right of Ryan. Our class began in the usual way, and it wasn't long before the professor and Ryan fell into their usual rhythm.  

However, this time I noticed something strange: Ryan kept flipping from the front of his notebook, where he was taking notes, to peaking at something in the back of his notebook. I watched Ryan intently for a few minutes, and on his next flip I pointed and asked, "what are you looking at?" "Nothing" Ryan replied, quickly closing his notes. However, I had seen what he was looking it - it was all the answers to that day's lesson. 




Mathematics prowess had become a currency in the group, and it was very valuable to be seen as one of the talented few. People would want to work with you, they would want to be in your study group and would want your help preparing for tests. It was desireable to be seen as a savant, and o

Each of the few students who remained in my program had found our their own way to rationalize why we were able to make the grade and why others had not, and subsequently dropped out or changed programs.
