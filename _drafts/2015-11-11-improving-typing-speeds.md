I'd like to try to answer this question in the way that [Charles Dodgson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll), more commonly known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll, would appreciate. You see, in addition to being an outstanding author Dodgson was an accomplished Mathematician, publishing nearly a dozen books in his own name on topics ranging from Linear Algebra to Mathematical Logic. Let's challenge

### How long would it take you to type Alice in Wonderland?
First, a few stats:

  * There are 26411 words, 141058 characters, and 116013 non-trivial characters in AIW. 
  * [The average person](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/good-typing-speed-per-minute-71789.html) types 38-40 words per minute (WPM)

From here, determining how long it would take an average person to type this story is trivial:  

**26411 Words / 40 WPM = 660 minutes or 11 hours.**

#### More to the story
Wait a second. How are words per minute calculated, anyways? Since words are all different lengths industry standardizes words per minute to be the [number of (non-trivial) characters typed per minute divided by 5](http://www.speedtypingonline.com/typing-equations).  

Our estimate of 660 minutes will be reasonably accurate as long as Carroll's (Dodgson's?) average word size is 5 characters. However:    
**116013 non-trivial characters / 26411 words = 4.39 characters per word**

The average typing speed of 40 WPM is based on 5 character words, let's adjust the average typing speed for Dodgson's (Carroll's?) smaller word size:    

**40 WPM * 5 characters = 200 characters per minute**
  
**200 CPM / 4.39 WPM = 45.6 Alice Words Per Minute (AWPM)**

Thus, the average keyboardist should be able to type Alice in Wonderland at a rate of 45.6 Alice Words Per Minute (AWPM). Repeating our calculations from above to determine the new typing time:  
  
**26411 Words / 45.6 AWPM = 579 minutes or 9.65 hours**

Not a bad estimate. 

### With 3 hours to practice, how could you best improve your time?

*Practice your typing, duh!* If this is your first thought, you're likely not as competitive as I am.  

Until now we've examined the question of how long it would take to type Alice in Wonderland much more theoretically than I would prefer. Moving beyond the answer of *practice your typing*, what specifically would we practice to improve our ability to type this particular text? Perhaps:  

  * Spend a few minutes increasing our speed typing *Alice*. This would be a great start, as the word Alice occurs exactly 398 times in the text. 
  * Practice other character names, such as *King* (179 times)*,Mouse* (84 times), or *Queen* (76 times).
  * Practice hammering out the words that occur most often, such as *the* (2305 times) or *her* 667 times.

All of the above would likely accomplish two things:  

  1. Improve the speed you could type Alice in Wonderland
  2. *Not* make a large improvement on your typing speed  

In other words, the improvements we would make in this 3 hours, although beneficial to our practical typing speed of this text, would likely not be predicted through our theoretical framework - # of Words divided by Typing Speed. 

#### Moving beyond averages
Ideas, such as practicing the most common words in this text, have merrit. However, perhaps we could improve on this idea by not simply looking at the words that most commonly appear in the text, but rather some combination of the words that commonly appear AND the words we are most slow at typing.  

To illustrate with an example, let's suppose our 26411 word text had only one simple sentence: "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled." We could analyze the time it takes us to type out each individual word, then seek to improve the words that we're slow at typing. 

Next: We could improve our speed typing these words, then extrapolated over a large text the size of Alice in Wonderland, we could make a major improvement. 

Next: Expand to letter cominations. 

Compare "Al" in Alice in Wonderland to "Al" in Snow White, for example. 

Measure the amount of improvement a small change would make.

Talk about how to improve over 3 hours.
